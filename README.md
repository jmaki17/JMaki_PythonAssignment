This is the official README.md for Joel's Python Assignment:

The assignment notebook that contains all the scripts, graphs, and answers to the various questions posed in the assignment is called "JMaki_Python_Assignment.ipynb".

The final, completed dataframe is labeled "Final_penguins_df.csv".

The README.md for the assignment has had it's name changed to the "Assignment_README.md" but has otherwise been unchanged.

The rest of the assignment files have been left unchanged and their names are the same.
